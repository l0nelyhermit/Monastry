# The Monastry - A Cultural Heritage With A Modern Twist
## First Project: User-Centric Frontend Development
This is a website that was made to promote a local boutique hotel to both local and guests looking for a unique experience in their stay in Singapore. The website aims to attract guests through its unique infrastructure and elements of Japanese culture through attractive visuals and interior room designs. The website consists of a home, room, dine,about,FAQ and contact page to allow users to have a complete picture of the alluring Monastry.
## Disclaimer
The Monastry is a fictional place that I had created as an Ideal boutique Japanese Hotel that would be represented in Singapore. As such, the images that were used for this project were taken from various sources and there is a possibility for association with other famous landmarks. These images are intended to project the design and architecture for the Monastry that I had intended for. Hence, they are not representative of the Monastry and are just used to communicate my idea of a Japanese Boutique Hotel.
## Strategy 
### Hotel's Perspective
* Given the unique architecture of the hotel, the hotel would want to use the visuals of the hotel as the focal point in its advertisement efforts to promote to all visitors. The hotel owner would hope for the hotel to have a place in every locals as an iconic landmark and a versatile location for many purposes such as marriage photoshoots.

* The hotel would like to have a method to connect with potential visitors and be able to answer their enquiries and feedback to maintain the high standards of the hotel.

### User's Perspective
* The user would like to be able to see the different facilities that are provided by the hotel. In terms of accomodation, users would like to have a clear understanding of the interior outlook of the rooms as well as the specific details to be able to make informed decisions.On the other hand, in terms of amenities, users would like to the food and beverages services available within the hotel. Finally, users would also like to be able to have a way to get in touch with the hotel to place a booking or for any other enquiries.

## UX 
My objectives in the design of the website was to allow users to have an easy access on the information presented on the website while striving for an emphasis on the visuals of the hotel as part of the hotel advertising efforts.In all of the pages a splash screen was used to as a welcoming introduction and an earth tone colour scheme was chosen to accentuate the cultural aspects of the 
Monastry. This allows the hotel to be able to capture the viewers attention as well as to provide a calming aspect befitting of the Japanese culture. To add on, the Monastry is spelt as such to give a close relation to the Monastrey but a different name that would resonate much better with the users.

Along with an interactive design achieved with the use of hover animation, users would be able to check for reservations, navigate to other pages, check for reviews and have an understanding of the surroundings of the Monastry all within the homepage.In the event that they are interested in receiving prompt updates and news from the hotel, they can just leave their email and subscribe to it via the 'Sign Up' button located at the footer of the page. In all of the pages, the footer is maintained consistently to allow users to navigate to the hotel's social media pages or to subscribe to our newsletter. 

Finally, with regards to the hotel's dining restaurant and bar, I have included buttons for visitors to be able navigate to their respective microsites or to simply download their menus. By doing so, this prevents an overcluttering of information on the webpage and to prevent users from being overloaded with information.Meanwhile, on the FAQ page and the Contact page, I have utilised the accordion and a form respectively to be able to guide users and allow them to seek clarifications easily.

* Navigation bar is mobile responsive and will change to a toggler upon detecting the screen size accordingly.In addition, the logo also redirects to the homepage (index.html) upon clicking action.

### Features Left to Implement

* Addition of the microsites and the menus to the Atlantis Bar and Zensation restaurant for the users to navigate and download respectively.
* Google Maps embedded in the main page should have location icons on places of interest to suggest to the users about the surroundings of the Monastry.
* Guest Reviews should relocate users to an external reviews site such as google reviews
* View room details should display more information on that particular type of room that the user wishes to view
* In the FAQ Page, the user should be able to navigate through the accordion through the search bar and should receive a feedback if question is not found.

### Bugs
* Upon shrinking of screen size, there are elements on the webpage that may not be displayed incorrectly and be out of position
* Carousels running in the dine page could look out of place when they are clicked despite having the same height for all of the images used for the carousel.
* When using the inspector to check for mobile responsivness, there are times upon shrinking the mobile size whereby there would be a visible white space beside the webpage or the page would not load properly.One quick fix that was used is to navigate to other webpages first and try to navigate back to the page that you wish to be on.
